# ðŸ”  Wordle Solver  

A Python-based Wordle solver that intelligently narrows down possible words using a mathematical model and an efficient algorithm.  

## ðŸš€ Features  
- **Optimized Search**: Filters words based on color-coded feedback (green, yellow, gray).  
- **Web & Backend Integration**: Designed with a user-friendly interface and backend support.  

## ðŸ“š How It Works  
1. **Input the Wordle feedback** (correct, misplaced, or absent letters).  
2. **Algorithm narrows down possible words** based on constraints.  
3. **Suggests the best possible guess** using an optimized strategy.
